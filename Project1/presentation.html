                    Our Local Government Unit (LGU) project, we have been focusing on
                    <span class="highlight-text">effective waste management</span>
                    practices, specifically the segregation of recyclable materials and non-biodegradable waste. Our
                    project involves the collection and sorting of these materials, which are then directed to Material
                    Recovery Facilities (MRFs). These facilities aim to efficiently process the materials and distribute
                    them to small-scale manufacturers. These manufacturers, in turn, use the materials to create
                    marketable products.
